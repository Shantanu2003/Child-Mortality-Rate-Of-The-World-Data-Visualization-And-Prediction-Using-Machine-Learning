Our project child Mortality rate data visualization and prediction will help the pediatric healthcare  system to predict the child mortality rate of the world 
  and take preventive measure  to reduce the world child mortality  rates. We have got inspiration for this project from the high child mortality rate of the 
  world specially in the African countries and under developed countries of the world.
We are targeting the healtcare area with this project.
Our project is under the open innovation category.
Our next aim is to create a machine learning model that uses real time data and predict the mortality rate and gives a vivid and precise visualization of it. 
Thank You
